# Refranero API

The Refranero API provides access to a collection of Spanish "refranes", with a word-by-word translation to English and a more appropriate English equivalent.
The Spanish "refranero" is a beautiful treasury of nuggets of wisdom to guide our lives, and sometimes, interpreting them doesn't quite cut it. Here, you'll find refranes, proverbs and expressions from across a multitude of Spanish-speaking countries.

The inspiration from this comes from the pains of being bilingual. My brain has lost the ability to distinguish between English and Spanish, so more often than not, I subconsciously use word-by-word translations in either language, creating amusing conversations for the people around me.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sergiocast97/refranero-api.git
   cd refranero-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any required environment variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Build the project (if using TypeScript):
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

6. For development mode with hot-reloading:
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
